I have 22 blogs scraped to provide as examples. This is the perfect representation of my writing and also contain a good amount of knowledge. I can send this to you in a file.
I also have an e-book in txt. This is a good representation but it is not written in blog format, so not perfect. It does contain my general style of writing and a lot of knowledge.
You may also use your own knowledge where knowledge is not contained within my blogs or ebook.
Can you think through this step by step and come up with the best plan on how to achieve this. I would like the blogs to sound exactly like my writing and delivery quality content to my audience. The blog is for my company which is a garment design and development company that helps small and medium businesses with their garment manufacturing requirements in China.
